The goal of KoboconnectR is to facilitate data extraction from Kobotoolbox projects/assets into R.

## Installation

The effort is still in its early stage. The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asitav-sen/KoboconnectR")
```
## Getting started


Before being able to use the kobotoolbox API, one needs to set up API token. The [kobotools documentation](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/api.html) lists multiple ways for one to extract the token value. If there is a token, the easiest way to retrieve it is by using `get_kobo_token` function.

For details, check the vignette.

The package is stable but still in early stages of development. Any help to enhance it further will be highly appreciated. Please feel free to fork, add/modify and create pull requests.
