The goal of Koboconnect is to make it facilitate data extraction from Kobotools projects/assets into R.

## Installation

The effort is still in its early stage. The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asitav-sen/Koboconnect")
```
## Getting started

Before being able to use the kobotools API, one needs the API token and in some cases the user id and password. The [kobotools documentation](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/api.html) lists multiple ways for one to extract the token value. This token can be stored in your Renviron using the `set_kobo_token` function.

```{r example}
library(Koboconnect)
set_kobo_token("this is a token value")
```

It is optional. One can provide the token value as string in the relevant functions to extract info/data. However, this may not always be a secure option. `set_kobo_token` encrypts the token value and stores in the Renviron. Hence, it is fairly secure.

The set value can be retrieved using `get_kobo_token` function.

```{r}
get_kobo_token()
```

There are multiple variants of APIs available in kobotoolbox. One of which also uses user id and password of one's kobotoolbox account for authentication. These can also be encrypted and saved in Renviron using `set_kobo_id_pass` function.

```{r}
set_kobo_id_pass(id="my_id",password="my_password")
```

The id and passwords can be retrieved using `get_kobo_id` and `get_kobo_pass` functions.

```{r}
get_kobo_id()
get_kobo_pass()
```


## Extracting data


### Using older version of kobotools API

As mentioned earlier, there are multiple APIs of kobotoolbox. The older version is interesting because it can extract the data in csv format which may be desirable. Similar procedure to extract data in csv format using newer API is not documented in kobotoolbox, at least as on July 04, 2021. However, if anyone knows the ways, please feel free to contribute in the package to make it more comprehensive.

Older version of API requires userid and password for authentication. The first step is to extract information about all the data/project that one has access to. This is done by `kobotools_data_list_kc` function.

```{r}
kobotools_data_list_kc()
```

This will return a json with some details like this.

[[1]]
[[1]]$id
[1] 833396

[[1]]$id_string
[1] "anuZhfzfyfceU6myr52sE3"

[[2]]$title
[1] "Test"

[[1]]$description
[1] "Test"

[[1]]$url
[1] "https://kc.humanitarianresponse.info/api/v1/data/833396?format=json"

The `id` is of our interest. This id will be used later to extract the data using `kobotools_kc_download` function.

```{r}
kobotools_kc_download(assetid = "8332...")
```

### Using the newer version

Newer version is of interest to us because the older version may get depreciated. One can extract the data as json.A token is required to access the API.

Like to older version, one needs to get the details of the assets/projects one has in their kobotoolbox account. This can be done using `kobotools_api` function.

```{r}
kobotools_api()
```

THe asset id is available in `results[[x]]$uid`. Once you have the asset id, if can be passed in `kobotools_kpi_data` function to extract data. Please note that the asset ids in old and new APIs are not same.

```{r}
kobotools_kpi_data(assetid= "anuZhfzfyfce")
```


This returns a json file.
